# Handelsregister.de Website Analysis

## Problem Statement

The original `handelsregister.py` script fails with the error:

```
mechanize._mechanize.FormNotFoundError: no form matching name 'form'
```

This occurs when trying to access the advanced search functionality on line 76:

```python
self.browser.select_form(name="form")
```

## Investigation Summary

### Original Script Approach

The script attempted to:

1. Navigate to homepage: `https://www.handelsregister.de`
2. Follow "Advanced search" link
3. Select form with `name="form"`
4. Fill search fields: `form:schlagwoerter` and `form:schlagwortOptionen`
5. Submit the form

### Current Website Structure

#### Homepage Analysis

- **Title**: "Registerportal | Homepage"
- **URL**: `https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/welcome.xhtml`
- **Technology**: JSF (JavaServer Faces) application

#### Forms Found on Homepage

5 forms detected, all with:

- **Action**: Points to `welcome.xhtml` (same page)
- **Method**: POST
- **Structure**: Contains JSF ViewState hidden fields
- **Names**: `headerForm`, `breadcrumbForm`, `naviForm`, `formID`, `footerForm`
- **No search fields**: None of these forms contain search functionality

#### Navigation Links

- **Normal search**: Links to `#` (JavaScript-only)
- **Advanced search**: Links to `#` (JavaScript-only)
- **All menu links**: Either point to `#` or external sites

#### Target URLs (provided by user)

- Normal search: `https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/normalesuche.xhtml`
- Advanced search: `https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/erweitertesuche.xhtml?cid=2`

Both URLs return **HTTP 400 Bad Request** when accessed directly.

### Technical Analysis

#### JSF Framework Detection

- Uses `javax.faces.ViewState` hidden fields
- ViewState values are long encoded strings (e.g., `6694484425797108668:423198998952736440...`)
- All forms post back to the same URL with ViewState management

#### JavaScript Requirements

- Navigation relies entirely on client-side JavaScript
- No direct URL access to search functionality
- No discoverable form submission endpoints
- Search functionality is not exposed as traditional HTML forms

#### Session Management

- No clear session ID pattern detected in URLs
- ViewState changes between requests
- Complex state management required for navigation

## Investigation Scripts Created

1. **`investigate_website.py`** - Initial website structure analysis
2. **`analyze_search_pages.py`** - Attempted to analyze specific search URLs
3. **`navigate_to_search.py`** - Tested navigation approaches with session context
4. **`find_form_endpoints.py`** - Searched for alternative endpoints and form actions

## Key Findings

### Why mechanize Cannot Work

1. **JavaScript Navigation**: All search links use JavaScript (`href="#"`)
2. **JSF Complexity**: Requires complex ViewState and component tree management
3. **No Direct Access**: Search pages reject direct URL access
4. **Client-Side Routing**: Navigation handled by JavaScript, not server redirects

### What Changed

The website has been completely redesigned from a traditional HTML form-based interface to a modern JSF application with JavaScript-based navigation. This is a fundamental architectural change that breaks mechanize compatibility.
